## 1. Loan Prediction using Machine Learning<br>
Project idea – The idea behind this ML project is to build a model that will classify how much loan the user can take. <br>
It is based on the user’s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments. You can build a linear model for this project. <br>
Dataset: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston

## 2. Fake News Detection Project
Project idea – Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era.<br>
You can learn how to distinguish fake news from a real one. You can use supervised learning to implement a model like this. <br>

## 3. Iris Flowers Classification Project
Project idea – The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals.<br>
This is a basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower.<br>
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris<br>

## 4. Housing Prices Prediction Project 
Project idea – The dataset has house prices of the Boston residual areas.<br>
The expense of the house varies according to various factors like crime rate, number of rooms, etc. It is a good ML project for beginners to predict prices on the basis of new data.<br>
